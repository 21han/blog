> the worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites. - Hugo

## Why host my own blog?

Not your hosting, not your blog. 

Third-party blogging services can take down your post anytime at their will. 

Do you want to put the power of your life
at other people's hands?

## Why Hugo?

- It is the fastest framework that I have used. 
  - run `hugo --templateMetrics` to test your build time
  - my build time is ðŸš€ **0.107 seconds** running on a 2019 MacBook Pro
- It is powered by Go, which I love.
- Can't get more secure than SSG, cause there is no backend! Nothing to hack.
- Hugo is free and open-sourced. ðŸ’°
- Supports markdown format for content publications.
- [Extremely easy to use]({{< ref "posts/hugo/setups.md" >}})
- [Fast to deploy]({{< ref "posts/hugo/deploy.md" >}})
