## Overview

**Amplify** integrates nicely with **GitHub**, which makes the whole
experience much better. 

I used this [walk-through](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-aws-amplify/) to set up my site, which automatically
deploys changes from my `main` branch.

I then registered and purchased my own domain from **AWS Route53**, and linked my domain with my amplify app using the 
**Domain Management** tool in **Amplify**.

Costs have been about $0.5 per month and under $9 per year for the domain name.

In my GitHub Project [README](https://github.com/21han/blog/#readme), I have added
the Amplify OneClick button so that I can quickly navigate to the console
to track my deployment process.
