My name is **Zihan Guo**. I am a senior software engineer at **[NYDIG](https://nydig.com/)**.

I build data-intensive software applications at work to bring **[Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/)** to Main Street. 


Outside of work, I enjoy riding my bike, exploring New Yorkâ€™s restaurants, playing squash, and hiking when the weather is cool and cozy.
On snowy days, I am usually found skiing in Vermont or Colorado.
When I feel exhausted, I love to meditate. My favorite meditation retreat centers are [Bhavana Society](https://bhavanasociety.org/) and [Dharma Drum](https://dharmadrumretreat.org/).
